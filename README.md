# Algorithm Visualizer

A tool that visually demonstrates how different algorithms (sorting, searching, pathfinding, etc.) work. This is a great educational resource.

## Features

- Visualize sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Visualize searching algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- Visualize pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra's, A*, etc.)

## How to Run

Open `src/index.html` in your web browser to start the visualization.
